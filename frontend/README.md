# Ethical Banking Frontend

Vite + React + Tailwind single-page app that implements the AskAI & TrustVault experience outlined in the hackathon plan. Components are already scaffolded for the four core screens so the team can wire real APIs on Day 2.

## Getting started

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` and will call the Spring gateway at `http://localhost:8080/api`.
